I developed a machine learning model to classify grades of liver cancer into four categories: RN & LOW, High, HCC in DN, and Progressed HCC.  
From 300 high-resolution pathology images (.svs), 1024Ã—1024 patches were generated based on regions of interest, following a computer vision-based approach. Quantitative cellular features from these patches were extracted using two software tools: CellProfiler and QuPath.   This approach simplified the task by converting image data into quantitative numerical data.  
Due to patient privacy, the data were confidential, and much of the detailed results may be omitted from the code.
